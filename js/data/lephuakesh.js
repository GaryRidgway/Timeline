    title: "Illithia becomes Idelia",
    year: "",
    description: "Originally creating the illithid out of spite for the Eon Anchael'Eon, Illithia created a species that also would collect knowledge. The illithid however, made of spite, collected it through the destruction of others. In addition the Illithid would use Illithia as a hive for their thoughts, continuously adding more and more to her mind until it became unbearable. Disgusted by her creations and embarassed by her emotional incomprehension of what her actions would create, Illithia banished herself to the far reach, the space beyond space until she could no longer feel the presence of her children calling to her. Eventually, after the last of the Balkanika conclave was destroyed at the turning of the 5th age, she returned to the Material plane and removed the last pieces that formed the old hivemind from her being, forever severing her from the Illithid. With this she hoped to rediscover the beauty in all the races created by her brothers and sisters, but never again create another species on her own."

    title: "Incranol is sent to the Vikan Realm",
    year: "",
    description: "<p>Incranol, as a young man of 30, was sent to the Vikan Realm from his home city of Sharr'Ichthoriadan in the underdark, hearing the words 'Vikan Realm' from some unknown corner of the city. A clone was left in his stead and he was transferred to the Realm which overlayed the Material. This space which bled gravity and time kept Incranol, the frightened young man, trapped for 500 years until the Havulg Mkoa. As Incranol festered in the Vikan Realm and fought for his life against the creatures that marred the landscape there, he became cold and disconnected with the material world. Why would a god of any kind create something like this?</p>\
    <p>In the end, Incranol gained the willpower to survive and the skills to thrive in the Vikan Realm, It did however cost him his empathy. No longer was there room in this mind for kindness for others, only calculated moves against those that opposed him. His ultimate goal now was to escape the Vikan Realm and return to the material plane, ready for an ascent that would eventually face him against the creator of the Vikan Realm itself.</p>\
    <p>Eventually, the Havulg Mkoa occured, and Incranol, returning to Sharr'Ichthoriadan and vastly outmatching his now drastically different clone, killed his doppelganger and retook his place astride mortal kind, determined to surpass any that stood between him and his goals, no matter the cost.</p>"

    year: "Istiday, the 7th of Uktar, 2993 of the Fourth Age",
    description: "<p>Upon his return to Sharr'Ichthoriadan, Incranol began to commence research. He learned of a city called Ihlyan'Thel that seemed to have more power across the lands above the underdark, which incranol percieved to be more pure and less beastial than Sharr'Ichthoriadan. They were also at war with Sharr'Ichthoriadan, and with this Incranol came to an idea. Incranol covertely conversed with them posing as an agent of good rebelling against the chaos of his bretheren, and agreed to try and undermine the houses of Sharr'Ichthoriadan from the inside in order to gain citizenship in Ihlyan'Thel.</p>\
    <p>Over time, Incranol allied with different houses in Sharr'Ichthoriadan as an unnamed informant and confidant. This allowed him to gain valuable information and then sell it to another house, detailing plots to undermine and destroy the houses he was working for in totality. Then, he would start the cycle over again for the next house he betrayed the last to. This cycle continued until the entirety of Sharr'Ichthoriadan was wiped to but a mere single house, weak enough for Ihlyan'Thel to destroy singlehandedly, and so they did.</p>\
    <p>And so with this Incranol was made an honorary citizen of high standing within Ihlyan'Thel. However, he did not disclose that with all of the killing that occured in Sharr'Ichthoriadan he utilized dark magic that he learned in the Vikan Realm to store the souls from his fallen fellow Sharr'Ichthoriadanians in a Vikanite Shard, storing the magic away from even the weave itself. He intends to use this magic in dire situations in which he would want to hide any magic he does from the eyes of the gods, as they could not detect the expendeture of his magic from this Vikanite Shard.</p>"

Aurelius took this reccomendation seriously and gave Incranol a position at the Gallerock Leyline, investigating it's power and protecting it from outside forces. Incranol would covertly and un-empathetically utilize this Leyline to further his secret desires to unravel the god that created the Vikan Realm, and to show them that no one controls Incranol Bevarr.</p>"

They got the Correct calculations for their ascent from The Shepherd (Akhil'Ikan), and needed but to be in stasis for a while until they reached a place to live amongst the stars. In order to achieve this, they offered their help to Ligera, who they allowed to tap in to their linked minds and use their strength to sequester the dragons. Ligera said this would be easier when they wer all in stasis, so she put them all in stasis before launch. As the vessel left however, Vedlar learned of the help they offered Ligera and tried to down the vessel, but was unsuccessful because of the intervention of Ligera and Sardior. Unfortunately the ship that was to take the Khal'Rai beyond Myria was caught in the gravity well of Castillo, the moon of Myria. In order for Ligera and Sardior to stop Vedlar from doing more harm they utilized the combined power of the Khal, both 'Rai' and 'Ari', to sequester away the Gem dragons and seal Vedlar. Sadly, They were unable to release the Khal'Rai from the gravity well of Castillo before this, and in exhaustion and loneliness made the closest celestial body, Castillo their resting place. They were to sleep and keep the sequester going until it was time to face Vedlar again, and perhaps this time the world would be more prepared."

    title: "Reveal the reason Rhadre'Al got pulled in to the material plane",
    year: "",
    description: "<p>When Ligera put the Khal'Rai in to stasis it severed some of their connection to the Khal'Ari. Normally when a Khal'Rai dies their soul goes to the Vikan realm, where the Khal'Ari reside. Their knowledge of the Material plane is then added to the Infinance, the collection of knowledge that the Khal'Ari maintain. Additionally, when a Khal'Rai dies a Khal'Ari is sent to replace them, forming a cycle of rebirth. The caveat however, is that no Khal'Rai can ever have any knowledge of the Vikan realm or its previous lives, so these meories are swiftly removed from its mind. This preserves the knowledge of lived experiences of mortals that can be added to the Infinance, something that the Khal'Ari severely lack.</p>\
    <p>When Ligera put the Khal'Rai in stasis, they were not able to link to the Vikan realm anymore, and as Isolde Moonwaker, the prime resident of the moons of Myria, slowly drained their essence, one Khal'Rai died, but was not able to make the connection with theVikan realm, and so their soul was lost forever. This left a need for a new Khal'Ari to come to the mortal plane. The subconcious of Sardior then looked across the Vikan Realm for someone with the ambition to find out what had happened here and undo his and Ligera's failings, and found Rhadre'Al.</p>\
    <p>The fact that Rhadre still remebers pieces of the Vikan Realm, the Khama, and more is a testament to his ambition, the bending of rules after the breaking of the bond between the Khal'Rai and the Khal'Ari, and Sardior's perserverence to give Rhadre a head start in this new and dangerous world.</p>"
